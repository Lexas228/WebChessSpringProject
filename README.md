Gala Chess in console


Chess console project where u can play with bot or just watch at two bot's game. U can set setting at usage class. 
This project was made by using microsevice architecture. Each service has it's own goal. (To find it's figure available move cells in this project).
Also I used spring framework to inject some kinds of dependecies and so on.
